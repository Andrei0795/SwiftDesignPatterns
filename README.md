# SwiftDesignPatterns


Swift is an amazing programming language. This app showcases a few of its design patterns, let's say, the most common ones.

1.  KVO
2. Notifications
3. Extensions
4. Factory
5. Singleton
6. Delegation
7. MVC

Every example has some explanations for it. Please feel free to learn and ask questions.
I will further update this readme file when I have a bit more time. There are many examples and tutorials and definitions online about these design patterns. It is through coding I understood how to better use them.
